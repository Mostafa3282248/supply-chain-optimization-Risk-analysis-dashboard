# supply-chain-optimization-Risk-analysis-dashboard
this project presents a complete analysis and optimization pipeline for real-world for real world logistics company based in south California. the goal is to reduce shipping cost,.predict delays ,reduce delays, predicting necessary maintenance dates , evaluate transportation risks , enhance operational efficiency using Using advanced analytics 
# project goals
Analyze real shipping data across time, weather, and transport modes .
predict shipment delays and disruptions using python models .
Recommended the best transport mode per shipmentbased on risk and cost . visualise key metrics , performance indicators , and optimization resultsin power bi .
# tools & technologies
python (pandas, scikit-learn,XGBoost , numpy , matplotlib.plplot ,seaborn ,warning, os, imblearn.over_sampling.somte,joblib,lp.
POWER BI (interactive visualisation and dashboarding)
excel/csv/power query(raw data storage and cleaning)
# KPIS Tracked :
total shipping cost.
Average shipping cost per shipment
high-risk shipment count.
average delivery time.
disruption and delay probabilities.
# Predictive Modeling:
Used python to build delay and risk prediction models .
factors included: weather severity , traffic, service level, distance , shipment weight.
# Optimization Logic:
Chose transport mode (truck, rail, drone) based on minimal cost , low disruption , and low delay probability .
produced an optimized shipment plan with reduced cost and risk.
# Dashboard high lights (POWER Bi)
Overview page with key metrics and historical shipping trends.
Delay and risk dashboards based on weather, congestion , tranport type.
# Author & Note
this is my first supply chain analytics  project  as a beginner  , working with real-world data from  logistics company in southern california . i continousely build practical projects to gain  hands -on experience in predictive modeling , dashboarding , and supply chain strategy.
the challenge was to choose the necessery liberaries , then test several models on python ,then choose  amulyi-output model, then train the model on the data several times untill it produces a logically  correct prediction , then after that the linear programming model , then the final file , then apply all of this project on power bi , and the data was samples that represented a corect and real representation of what  is present  in the company's file , meaning that the prediction model can be applied to the company.
